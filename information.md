### Uppsala Biomedical Center (BMC)

Enter through the C11 entrance, now also called the SciLife entrance. Forward and and to the right 
from the C11 entrance is the door to the new SciLife building ("the Hub"; E10 on the map) built on 
one of the inner courtyards of BMC. If you do not have an access card you will need someone to let 
you in through to the door to the Hub. The room for the course, E10:1309, is on the ground floor of 
the new building.
