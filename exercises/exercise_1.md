# Getting started in Genome Assembly

## Exercises:

### Test: Test your connection to uppmax.

Follow the instructions to log into the [UPPMAX cluster Rackham](../uppmax_login.md).

Test if graphical applications are available to you by typing the following:

```bash
module load bioinfo-tools FastQC
fastqc
```

### Task 1: Describe your own project

* Describe the properties of your genome of interest
* What might hinder DNA extraction for your organism?
* Which sequencing technologies are suitable for your assembly?
* What kind of computational resources might you need?
* How difficult is level of assembly you're trying to achieve?
