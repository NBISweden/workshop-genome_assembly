# Map over Uppsala biomedical center

Enter through the C11 entrance, now also called the SciLife entrance. Forward and right from the C11 entrance is the door to the new SciLife buidling ("the Hub"; E10 on the map) built on one of the inner courtyards of BMC. Before you have recieved your card you will need someone to let you in through to the door to the Hub. The room for the course, E10:1309, is on the ground floor of the new building.
