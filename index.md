# De Novo Genome Assembly Workshop

**Instructors:**

**Henrik Lantz**, Uppsala University, SciLifeLab, NBIS, Elixir-SE.

**Mahesh Binzer-Panchal**, Uppsala University, SciLifeLab, NBIS, Elixir-SE.

**Lucile Soler**, Uppsala University, SciLifeLab, NBIS, Elixir-SE.

**Jacques Dainat**, Uppsala University, SciLifeLab, NBIS, Elixir-SE.

**Date and Location:**

The workshop is held at the Uppsala Biomedical Center, Uppsala, Sweden, on November 20-22 2018.

## Course Purpose:

This workshop is primarily aimed at researchers getting into their first de novo assembly project, but
also includes information for the more experienced researcher. We cover the assembly of both prokaryotes
and eukaryotes, and spend time learning how to run and interpret analyses through computer exercises
and lectures. Participants are taken through all steps of genome assembly, from quality assessment of
data, through assembly, to validation of assemblies. After the course, the student will be familiar
with common practices in genome assembly projects, and how to deal with common pitfalls.
