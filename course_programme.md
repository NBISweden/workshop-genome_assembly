## Session 1: Getting started in Genome Assembly

Learning Objectives:

* Investigating properties of the genome of interest
* Extract high quality DNA
* Choice of sequencing technology
* Estimation of necessary computing resources
* Scales of difficulty in genome assembly - Chart of what is easy to achieve -> what is hard to achieve

Learning Outcomes:

* Students will know which properties of the genome should be investigated before starting a sequencing project.
* Students will know what might hinder DNA extraction.
* Students will know how to select appropriate sequencing technology.
* Students will know how to estimate computational resources.
* Students will know how to estimate project difficultly.

Exercises:

* Can they describe properties of their genome of interest?
* What might hinder DNA extraction for their organism?
* Which sequencing technologies are suitable for assembly?
* What kind of computational resources might they need?
* How difficult is what they're trying to achieve?

## Session 2: Sequencing Technologies

Learning Objectives:

* Understand
