# Getting started in Genome Assembly

[Slides](../slides/genome_properties.pdf):

## Objectives:

* Understand how to design a de novo assembly project.
* Understand which properties of the genome are important to consider.
* Understand factors that influence extraction of high quality DNA.
* Understand how to choose appropriate sequencing technologies.
* Understand how to estimate necessary computer resources.
* Understand how to make a pilot project.
* Understand what is easy and difficult to attain with de novo assembly.

## Exercises:

### Task 1: Test your connection to uppmax.

Follow the instructions to log into the [UPPMAX cluster Rackham](../uppmax_login.md).

Test if graphical applications are available to you by typing the following:

```bash
module load bioinfo-tools FastQC
fastqc
```

### Task 2: Describe your own project
